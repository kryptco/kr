Low level implementation of leveled execution logs for Go.

It is a fork of the github.com/golang/glog (c6f9652c7179652e2fd8ed7002330db089f4c9db) package that is itself an efficient pure Go implementation of leveled
logs in the manner of the open source C++ package

	http://code.google.com/p/google-glog

Changes:
- This version refactors code to not rely on a single global variable
  and associated log state.
- It separates out the flag parsing so that an application can choose
  to use whatever command-line flags they wish to configure the
  package.
- When built with the 'android' build tag (such as with gomobile),
  it uses the Android logging primitives instead of writing to files.
